An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-114.131211"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset "},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"42.009517"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":"tl_2013_06_place.shp.xml"},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"431430d9-7408-48c3-890d-e0a9cc516c12"},{"key":"metadata-language","value":""},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-124.482003, 32.528832], [-114.131211, 32.528832], [-114.131211, 42.009517], [-124.482003, 42.009517], [-124.482003, 32.528832]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"completed"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Access Constraints: None\", \"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\n\n\nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Primary roads are generally divided, limited-access highways within the interstate highway system or under State management, and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges.  These highways are accessible by ramps and may include some toll highways.  The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) is S1100 for primary roads.  Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. Highway, State Highway, and/or County Highway system.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-74.689502"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset "},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"42.516072"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":"tl_2013_42_tract.shp.xml"},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"0e85590a-a1ba-49c8-a435-3dbd2346620c"},{"key":"metadata-language","value":""},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-80.519851, 39.719799], [-74.689502, 39.719799], [-74.689502, 42.516072], [-80.519851, 42.516072], [-80.519851, 39.719799]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"completed"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Access Constraints: None\", \"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-82.122971"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset "},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"48.306063"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":"tl_2013_26_place.shp.xml"},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"431430d9-7408-48c3-890d-e0a9cc516c12"},{"key":"metadata-language","value":""},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-90.418392, 41.696118], [-82.122971, 41.696118], [-82.122971, 48.306063], [-90.418392, 48.306063], [-90.418392, 41.696118]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"completed"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Access Constraints: None\", \"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

Face refers to the areal (polygon) topological primitives that make up MTDB. A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces, not any interior edges contained within the area of the face. The Topological Faces Shapefile contains the attributes of each topological primitive face. Each face has a unique topological face identifier (TFID) value. Each face in the shapefile includes the key geographic area codes for almost all geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data for both the 2010 Census and Census 2000. The geometries of each of these geographic areas can then be built by dissolving the face geometries on the appropriate key geographic area codes in the Topological Faces Shapefile.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-96.516866"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset"},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"32.989328"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":""},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"89f89c6f-741c-4121-98e3-d3f1f528ff53"},{"key":"bbox-south-lat","value":"32.545214"},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-97.038385, 32.545214], [-97.038385, 32.989328], [-96.516866, 32.989328], [-96.516866, 32.545214], [-97.038385, 32.545214]]]}"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-79.974306"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset"},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"31.000968"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":""},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"2f66af77-8b99-4e00-bbf9-d4d93393a197"},{"key":"bbox-south-lat","value":"24.396308"},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-87.634896, 24.396308], [-87.634896, 31.000968], [-79.974306, 31.000968], [-79.974306, 24.396308], [-87.634896, 24.396308]]]}"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-93.508039"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset "},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"36.500704"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":"tl_2013_48_place.shp.xml"},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"431430d9-7408-48c3-890d-e0a9cc516c12"},{"key":"metadata-language","value":""},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-106.645646, 25.837164], [-93.508039, 25.837164], [-93.508039, 36.500704], [-106.645646, 36.500704], [-106.645646, 25.837164]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"completed"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Access Constraints: None\", \"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014). For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center. In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products were revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.","owner_org":"bd2cdd5a-4d65-46c0-9937-c8381175f104","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-63.672192"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset"},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"52.877264"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":""},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"ec7f7cc1-fb25-4f69-9804-fe64c411c69a"},{"key":"bbox-south-lat","value":"21.742308"},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-130.232828, 21.742308], [-63.672192, 21.742308], [-63.672192, 52.877264], [-130.232828, 52.877264], [-130.232828, 21.742308]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"underDevelopment"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Use Constraints: None\", \"Access Constraints: None\"]"},{"key":"temporal-extent-begin","value":"2004-04-09"},{"key":"contact-email","value":"custserv@usgs.gov"},{"key":"bbox-west-long","value":"-130.232828"},{"key":"metadata-date","value":"2016-09-19"},{"key":"dataset-reference-date","value":"[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2014-10-10\"}]"},{"key":"frequency-of-update","value":"EVERY 5 YEARS"},{"key":"licence","value":"[\"Although these data have been processed successfully on a computer system at the USGS, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the USGS regarding the use of the data on any other system, nor does the act of distribution constitute any such warranty.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-89.483385"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset "},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"49.384358"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":"tl_2013_27_place.shp.xml"},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"431430d9-7408-48c3-890d-e0a9cc516c12"},{"key":"metadata-language","value":""},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-97.239196, 43.499361], [-89.483385, 43.499361], [-89.483385, 49.384358], [-97.239196, 49.384358], [-97.239196, 43.499361]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"completed"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Access Constraints: None\", \"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-71.777491"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset "},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"45.015865"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":"tl_2013_36_tract.shp.xml"},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"0e85590a-a1ba-49c8-a435-3dbd2346620c"},{"key":"metadata-language","value":""},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-79.76259, 40.477399], [-71.777491, 40.477399], [-71.777491, 45.015865], [-79.76259, 45.015865], [-79.76259, 40.477399]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"completed"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Access Constraints: None\", \"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.\nThe TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.","owner_org":"31c49abe-512a-412a-9cc7-5b2601325d6b","extras":[{"key":"bbox-east-long","value":"-104.052245"},{"key":"resource-type","value":"dataset "},{"key":"bbox-north-lat","value":"45.005886"},{"key":"coupled-resource","value":"[]"},{"key":"guid","value":"tl_2013_56_place.shp.xml"},{"key":"spatial_harvester","value":true},{"key":"collection_package_id","value":"431430d9-7408-48c3-890d-e0a9cc516c12"},{"key":"metadata-language","value":""},{"key":"spatial-reference-system","value":""},{"key":"spatial","value":"{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-111.056889, 40.99461], [-104.052245, 40.99461], [-104.052245, 45.005886], [-111.056889, 45.005886], [-111.056889, 40.99461]]]}"},{"key":"progress","value":"completed"},{"key":"access_constraints","value":"[\"Access Constraints: None\", \"Use Constraints: The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.
